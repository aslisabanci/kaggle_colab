# Setting up Kaggle environment on Google Colab

## Get your things ready💼
After you sign up for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) (which is for free), go ahead and get your API token from your [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) account. You will find this under your Profile > Account section. Kaggle will create a JSON file and you'll download it on your machine. 

## Run the commands on the notebook🏃‍♀️
Then create a notebook and there you can run these commands to install the Kaggle framework, then handle the authentication between Google Colab and Kaggle and start using the Kaggle API to list / search competitions / datasets, download the data on your virtual machine.

## Enjoy🤸‍♀️
After you have your data ready, install the frameworks you need on your virtual machine and take off with your machine learning adventures, running on Google's GPUs for free.
